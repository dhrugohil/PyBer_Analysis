# PyBer_Analysis
## By Dhru Gohil

### Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to create a summary data frame of the ride-sharing data by city type and further creating a multiple-line graph to visualize our data, showing the total weekly fares for each city type. This data analysis will aid the decision makers at PyBer as they will be able to see the differences between the data for each city type.


#### Total Fares Differences

Above is a multiple-line chart that show cases the total fare for every city type within 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28. The Y-axis is the total fare in USD, while the X-axis is the date in form of months. It is clearly evident that Pyber is utilized mostly in Urban cities followed by Suburban and then Rural, for obvious reasons, as Urban cities have the most traffic and population. 
Furthermore, looking closely at the curves, we can notice an upward trend and peak at the end of Feb, right before March, this could be edue eto a number of reasons, as it is common in all city types.
Latly, towards the end of April and the multiple-line chart, the total fares for Suburban cities is on the rise while for Urban and Rural cities, it seems to be dropping.

Below is the summary dataframe to have a quick glimpse at the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

### Summary
The code ectracted relevant data needed to create our custo![Uploading Screen Shot 2021-12-04 at 6.02.31 PM.pngâ€¦]()
m data frame and further tidyed the data making it suitable for analysis and visualization. Ready for decision-making!

#### Recommendation
1. Lower fares in Rural areas may lead to a loss of drivers willing to work there, management can increase offers and marketting to attract more demand from Rural areas.
2. Suburban cities seem to be experiencing an increase in total fares, therefore, the growing demend for Pyber indicated a cash cow which needs investment to realise full potential.
3. Rural cities seems to be having a downward trend, this may be due to the competition present in populated urban cities, management could reduce rates in urban. cities to drive out competition inorder to increase their consumer base.
